### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am TheWinDev, a lil teen developer with love for electronics, application developing, hard and software testing and just looking through Github :p
My current projects are the KaliCMD for Windows
my IP Checker which is outdated xD
and my Windows Tool PE builder *which apprently isn't here on github...*

I like servers and high performance computing :D

Thats all about me ^^

Oh, and here's my discord if you want to talk with me: TheWinDev#1660 

Have fun with my projects, TheWinDev out :D

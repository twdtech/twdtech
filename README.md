### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am TheWinDev, a lil teen developer with love for electronics, application developing, hard and software testing and just looking through Github :p

My current projects are:
- KaliCMD for Windows
- my IP Checker which is outdated xD
- my Windows Tool PE builder *which apprently isn't here on github...*
- and Splitix File Splitter

I like servers and high performance computing :D  
Thats all about me ^^

Oh, and here's my discord if you want to talk with me: thewindev  
Have fun with my projects, TheWinDev out :D
